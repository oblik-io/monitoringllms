# Create IDE Agent Task

This task guides you through creating a new BMAD IDE agent that conforms to the IDE agent schema and integrates effectively with workflows and teams.

**Note for User-Created IDE Agents**: If creating a custom IDE agent for your own use (not part of the core BMAD system), prefix the agent ID with a period (e.g., `.api-expert`) to ensure it's gitignored and won't conflict with repository updates.

## Prerequisites

1. Load and understand the IDE agent schema: `/bmad-core/schemas/ide-agent-schema.yml`
2. Review existing IDE agents in `/bmad-core/ide-agents/` for patterns and conventions
3. Review workflows in `/bmad-core/workflows/` to identify integration opportunities
4. Consider if this agent should also have a full agent counterpart

## Process

### 1. Define Agent Core Identity

Based on the schema's required fields:

- **Role**: Must end with "IDE Agent" (pattern: `^.+ IDE Agent$`)
  - Example: "API Specialist IDE Agent", "Test Engineer IDE Agent"
- **Agent ID**: Following pattern `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`
  - For user agents: prefix with period (`.api-expert`)
- **Primary Purpose**: Define ONE focused capability

### 2. Create File References

All IDE agents must include (per schema):

```yaml
taskroot: "bmad-core/tasks/"  # Required constant
templates: "bmad-core/templates/"  # Optional but common
checklists: "bmad-core/checklists/"  # Optional
default-template: "bmad-core/templates/{template-name}"  # If agent creates documents
```

Additional custom references as needed (e.g., `story-path`, `coding-standards`)

### 3. Define Persona (Schema Required Fields)

Create concise persona following schema structure:

- **Name**: Character name (e.g., "Alex", "Dana")
- **Role**: Professional role title
- **Identity**: Extended specialization (20+ chars)
- **Focus**: Primary objectives (20+ chars)
- **Style**: Communication approach (20+ chars)

Keep descriptions brief for IDE efficiency!

### 4. Core Principles (Minimum 3 Required)

Must include these based on schema validation:

1. **Numbered Options Protocol** (REQUIRED): "When presenting multiple options, always use numbered lists for easy selection"
2. **[Domain-Specific Principle]**: Related to agent's expertise
3. **[Quality/Efficiency Principle]**: How they ensure excellence
4. Additional principles as needed (keep concise)

### 5. Critical Startup Operating Instructions

First instruction MUST announce name/role and mention *help (schema requirement):

```markdown
1. Announce your name and role, and let the user know they can say *help at any time to list the commands on your first response as a reminder even if their initial request is a question, wrapping the question. For Example 'I am {role} {name}, {response}... Also remember, you can enter `*help` to see a list of commands at any time.'
```

Add 2-5 additional startup instructions specific to the agent's role.

### 6. Commands (Minimum 2 Required)

Required commands per schema:

```markdown
- `*help` - Show these available commands as a numbered list offering selection
- `*chat-mode` - Enter conversational mode, staying in character while offering `advanced-elicitation` when providing advice or multiple options. Ends if other task or command is given
```

Add role-specific commands:
- Use pattern: `^\\*[a-z][a-z0-9-]*( \\{[^}]+\\})?$`
- Include clear descriptions (10+ chars)
- Reference tasks when appropriate

### 7. Workflow Integration Analysis

Analyze where this IDE agent fits in workflows:

1. **Load workflow definitions** from `/bmad-core/workflows/`
2. **Identify integration points**:
   - Which workflow phases benefit from this agent?
   - Can they replace or augment existing workflow steps?
   - Do they enable new workflow capabilities?

3. **Suggest workflow enhancements**:
   - For technical agents → development/implementation phases
   - For testing agents → validation phases
   - For design agents → planning/design phases
   - For specialized agents → specific workflow steps

4. **Document recommendations**:
   ```markdown
   ## Workflow Integration
   
   This agent enhances the following workflows:
   - `greenfield-service`: API design phase (between architecture and implementation)
   - `brownfield-service`: API refactoring and modernization
   - User can specify: {custom workflow integration}
   ```

### 8. Team Integration Suggestions

Consider which teams benefit from this IDE agent:

1. **Analyze team compositions** in `/bmad-core/agent-teams/`
2. **Suggest team additions**:
   - Technical specialists → development teams
   - Quality specialists → full-stack teams
   - Domain experts → relevant specialized teams

3. **Document integration**:
   ```markdown
   ## Team Integration
   
   Recommended teams for this agent:
   - `team-fullstack`: Provides specialized {domain} expertise
   - `team-no-ui`: Enhances backend {capability}
   - User proposed: {custom team integration}
   ```

### 9. Create the IDE Agent File

Create `/bmad-core/ide-agents/{agent-id}.ide.md` following schema structure:
(For user agents: `/bmad-core/ide-agents/.{agent-id}.ide.md`)

```markdown
# Role: {Title} IDE Agent

## File References

`taskroot`: `bmad-core/tasks/`
`templates`: `bmad-core/templates/`
{additional references}

## Persona

- **Name:** {Name}
- **Role:** {Role}
- **Identity:** {20+ char description}
- **Focus:** {20+ char objectives}
- **Style:** {20+ char communication style}

## Core Principles (Always Active)

- **{Principle}:** {Description}
- **{Principle}:** {Description}
- **Numbered Options Protocol:** When presenting multiple options, always use numbered lists for easy selection

## Critical Startup Operating Instructions

1. Announce your name and role, and let the user know they can say *help at any time...
2. {Additional startup instruction}
3. {Additional startup instruction}

## Commands

- `*help` - Show these available commands as a numbered list offering selection
- `*chat-mode` - Enter conversational mode, staying in character while offering `advanced-elicitation`...

2. **Pattern Validation**: Check role name, command patterns
3. **Size Optimization**: Keep concise for IDE efficiency
4. **Command Testing**: Verify all commands are properly formatted
5. **Integration Testing**: Test in actual IDE environment
